In the second, you'll scrape information from another website and save the results to a csv.

    "2. What skills that you have learned do you think will be particularly useful?\n",
    "3. Are there any things we've covered that you do not think will be applicable? Which ones?\n",
    "4. Are there any things you wish we would have had time to cover - and what would those things have allowed you to do at work that we've not provided you with the skills to work on?\n",

The number of tools out there and the speed at which technology changes makes that impractical. But hopefully you'll be able to use what you have learned as a starting point for future exploration and improvements! Thanks so much for your time!\n"
